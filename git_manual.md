## harsh truth

## git init
This is the command you need to use if you want to start a new empty repository or to reinitialize an existing one in the project root. It will create a .git directory with its subdirectories. It should look like this:
_git init_

## git add
This is the command you need to use to stage changed files. You can stage individual files:
_git add **file path**_

## git commit
This one is probably the most used Git command. After changes are done locally, you can save them by “committing” them. A commit is like local a snapshot of the current state of the branch, to which you can always come back. To create a new commit, type this command in Git Bash:
_git commit -m **"commit message"**_

## git branch
Using git branch will list all the branches of the repository:
_git branch_
Or you can use it to create a new branch, without checking it out:
_git branch **new branch**_

## git checkout
You can use the checkout command to switch the branch that you are currently working on.
_git checkout **branch name**_
